# Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy complex commerce and trade models for Xerox (Prototype company). Our primary goal is to design and implement service 
solutions that allow Xerox to bundle products tailored to meet the specific needs of customers across various channels, including social media, television, 
and radio. We are adopting a dynamic range pricing strategy (floor, target, ceiling) to optimize solution selling.

## Pricing Strategy Explained
### Floor Price: 
The minimum price below which a salesperson is not permitted to offer any discount. This ensures profitability and compliance with our pricing policy.
### Ceiling Price: 
The maximum possible quoted price for any product, representing the upper limit of what can be charged.
### Target Price: 
The benchmark price salespeople strive to achieve to meet their sales targets and prevent losses to the organization.

## Project Objectives
The project is focused on the following key deliverables:

#### Top Negotiated Solutions: 
Identify and analyze the top three best-negotiated solutions that sell above the target price, broken down by market segments.
#### Best Customers: 
Highlight the top three customers purchasing above the target price.
#### Top Salespeople: 
Determine the top three salespeople who consistently sell above the target price.
#### Marginal Revenue Analysis: 
Calculate the total marginal revenue for each market, distinguishing between revenues above or below the expected target (actual vs. target).
#### Pricing Optimization: 
Assess the effectiveness of current pricing strategies and provide recommendations for adjusting price ranges to ensure optimal performance, both at higher and lower target levels.
